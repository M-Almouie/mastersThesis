Change hyper-parameters:
    - Measure confusion matrix  (heatmap on prediction set)
    - f1 scores                 (heatmap on prediction set)
    - accuracy/loss curves      (graphs on training validation and prediction test)

Parameters to test:
    - Batch sizes: 8, 16, 32, 64, 128
    - layers:
        * number of identical layers (depth)
        * sizes of layers (width)
    - different dropouts
    - make iterations large enough

Models to date:
    Depth:
        Model 1: deep (2 x 32 layers, 2 x 64 layers, 2 x 128 fully connected layers)
        Model 3: deep (3 x 32 layers, 3 x 64 layers, 2 x 128 fully connected layers)

    Width:
        Model 2: wide (2 x 64 layers, 1 x 128 layer, 2 x 256 fully connected layers)
        Model 4: wide (2 x 16 layers, 1 x 32 layer, 2 x 64 fully connected layers)
